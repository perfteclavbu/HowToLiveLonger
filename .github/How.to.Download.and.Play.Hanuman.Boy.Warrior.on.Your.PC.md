Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download and install PCSX2 from [here](https://pcsx2.net/download.html). Make sure you have the latest version and follow the instructions on the website.
2. Download a PS2 BIOS file from [here](https://romsmania.cc/bios/ps2-bios-3). This is a file that contains the system software of the PS2 console. You will need this to run PCSX2. Extract the file and place it in the "bios" folder of PCSX2.
3. Download an ISO file of Hanuman Boy Warrior from [here](https://dlpsgame.com/hanuman-boy-warrior-ps2-free/). This is a file that contains the game data. You will need this to play the game. Extract the file and place it in a folder of your choice.

5. Click on "System" > "Boot ISO (fast)" and wait for the game to load.

Note: You may need to adjust some settings in PCSX2 to optimize the game performance and graphics. You can find more information on how to do that [here](https://pcsx2.net/getting-started.html).
  
If you are wondering what the game is about, it is loosely based on the childhood adventures of Hanuman, the monkey god who is one of the main characters in the Ramayana. You will have to fight various enemies and bosses from the Indian mythology, such as demons, snakes, crocodiles, and even Ravana himself. You will also have to solve some puzzles and platforming challenges along the way.
 
The game tries to emulate the gameplay style of God of War, but fails miserably. The combat is dull and repetitive, with only one attack button and a few special moves that you can unlock by collecting coins. The enemies are dumb and easy to kill, and the boss fights are uninspired and boring. The camera is also a mess, often getting stuck behind walls or trees, making it hard to see what's going on. The graphics are dated and bland, with low-resolution textures and poor animations. The sound effects are generic and annoying, and the music is forgettable.
 
The game also suffers from a lot of bugs and glitches, such as enemies getting stuck in walls, Hanuman falling through the ground, or the game crashing randomly. The game is very short and can be completed in a few hours, but there is no incentive to replay it or explore the levels. There is no multiplayer mode or any extra features to add value to the game.
 
Hanuman Boy Warrior is a game that should have never been made. It is a disgrace to the PlayStation 2 platform and to the Indian gaming industry. It is not a game for casual gamers or hardcore gamers or anyone who enjoys playing games. It is a game that should be avoided at all costs.
